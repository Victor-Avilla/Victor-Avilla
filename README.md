<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Victor üëã</h1>

---

As a professional transitioning into Web Development, I bring four years of experience from Vale S.A., where I worked across industrial maintenance, administrative processes, team leadership, and the implementation of continuous improvement methodologies such as Kanban, Kaizen, CCQ, and A3. My responsibilities included managing KPIs, driving team engagement, operating SAP systems, delivering presentations to leadership, and conducting training sessions for cross-functional teams. Consistent annual recognition reflected my performance, accountability, and results-driven mindset.

Over the past year, I‚Äôve been specializing in fullstack development with a focus on React, JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB. Through hands-on academic projects, I‚Äôve applied responsiveness, front-back integration, component-based architecture, and UI/UX best practices.

Now, I‚Äôm seeking my first opportunity in tech to merge my solid corporate foundation‚Äîbuilt on discipline, organization, and collaboration‚Äîwith my evolving technical expertise.

Proactive, communicative, and transparent, I‚Äôm committed to continuous learning in both technical and soft skills. My goal is to contribute to innovative, collaborative environments where growth and impact go hand in hand.
